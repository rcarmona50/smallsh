Assignment: Assignment 3: Smallsh
Description: Write smallsh shell in C. 
smallsh will implement a subset of features of well-known shells, such as bash.


1. Compile the program:
   gcc --std=gnu99 -o smallsh main.c

2. To run the script, place it in the same directory as your compiled shell, 
   chmod it (chmod +x ./p3testscript) and run this command from a bash prompt:

   $ ./p3testscript 2>&1
